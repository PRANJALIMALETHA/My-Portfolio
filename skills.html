        <strong>Contribution to GirlScript Summer of Code</strong><br>
        <strong>Project:</strong> First Pull Request (PR)<br>
        <strong>Role:</strong> Contributor<br>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Submitted my initial PR by enhancing the styling of webpages for the GirlScript Summer of Code project. Implemented various CSS properties to significantly improve the visual appeal and user experience of the web pages.<br>
        <strong>Challenges:</strong> Faced initial difficulties due to a lack of practical knowledge on raising PRs and CSS styling. Overcame these challenges through persistence and learning.<br>
        <strong>Outcome:</strong> Initially uncertain if my changes would be accepted, but received positive feedback and saw my contributions integrated into the project. This experience marked my entry into the world of open source development.
